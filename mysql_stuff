USE tpch
mysql --local-infile=1 -uroot --password=\!ong\-horn
ql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE USER 'tpch'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE tpch;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON tpch.* to 'tpch'@'%';
mysql> USE tpch;
mysql> \. tpch/gen/dss.ddl

Then, in the gen directories, you can modify the query generator to generate queries that are as close as possible to what you need:

cp makefile.suite makefile
#Modify makefile to use
# CC = gcc, DATABASE=SQLSERVER, MACHINE=LINUX, WORKLOAD=TPCH
#In tpcd.h, SQLSERVER section:
# change #define SET_DBASE "use %s;\n"
# change #define SET_ROWCOUNT "limit %d;\n\n"
# change #define START_TRAN "BEGIN WORK;"
# change #define END_TRAN "COMMIT WORK;"
make

Then you can start generating database data at the right scale factor

./dbgen -s 1

And also modify the constraints/indices file so that it's compatible with mysql:

# Modify dss.ri
# use a search and replace in order to remove "CONNECT TO TPCD", remove references to "TPCD." and remove the lines "COMMIT WORK;"

Then you can load all the data into the databases with

mysql -u tpch -p
mysql> use tpch;
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'customer.tbl' INTO TABLE CUSTOMER FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|';
# Same with orders, lineitem, nation, partsupp, part, region, supplier
mysql> \. dss.ri

You then need to change the case of the table names because the queries use lower-case table names I think whereas the dss.ddl uses upper-case names for the tables:

mysql> alter table NATION rename nation;
# Ditto for supplier, region, partsupp, part, orders, lineitem, customer

Finally, you can test some of the queries

cp dists.dss queries
cd queries
../qgen -c tpch -s 1 1 

I think the queries still need to be modified a bit to be compatible. I think queries with a limit may need the semi-colon moved around, the precision indicator during date arithmetic in query 1 may need to be removed, and the method for naming columns in query 13 might need changing.
